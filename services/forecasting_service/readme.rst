FORECASTING SERVICE
===================

This application will read actual data from the database and generate
a forecast for traffic rates in the future.

The application can be run as an individual docker container
and can be launched using the docker-compose file included in the project's
root directory.

This service is designed to work with the charting service to provide plots with forecasted values.

This service provides an API accessible via URL calls that can train new models, get a list of available models, or run predictions based on existing models.  Calls to predict values are flexible so that the service picks the best-scoring model to predict based on the model selection parameters provided.

This service will use the postgres database Docker container used in the
monitor application. The docker-compose file will achieve this by
connecting to the network that the monitor_db container is running.

The models defined in this application were auto-generated by Django and
provide ORM references to the application's database which are read-only.

To generate the models.py file, call ``python manage.py inspectdb > models.py``
from the application that is already using the database.  The resulting models.py
file will include definitions for all of the database's tables and can be used in this forecasting application.
