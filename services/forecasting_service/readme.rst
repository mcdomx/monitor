FORECASTING SERVICE
===================

This application will read actual data from the database and generate
a forecast for traffic rates in the future.

The application is intended to be run as an individual docker container
and can be launched using the docker-compose file included in the project's
root directory.

This service will use the postgres database Docker container used in the
monitor application. The docker-compose file will achieve this by
connecting to the network that the monitor_db container is running.

The models defined in this application were auto-generated by Django and
provide ORM references to the application's database which are read-only.

To generate the models.py file, call ``python manage.py inspectdb > models.py``
from the application that is already using the database.  The resulting models.py
file will include definitions for all of the database's tables.
